# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to our Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms class! This course will guide you through the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand and implement common data structures
2. Develop and analyze algorithms

## Course Schedule

## Assessment Criteria

Here is how the course grade is determined:

1. Machine Problems (MPs): 40% (5 MPs, each 8%)
2. Exams: 30% (Mid-term 15% + Final 15%)
3. Final Project: 20%
4. Final Project Presentation: 5%
5. Peer Support: 5%

## GitHub Discussions

Active engagement is key. **5%** of your grade is based on your participation and contributions.

- **Solve Challenges Faster**: Pool collective wisdom. Someone might have the answer you need.
  
- **Reinforce Your Learning**: Answering peers' queries helps solidify your grasp on topics.
  
- **Stay Updated**: Get valuable insights, resources, and clarifications from active discussions.
  
- **Network**: Forge connections. Today's discussion peer might be tomorrow's collaborator.

Remember: quality over quantity. Make your contributions meaningful. Simply responding with "I agree" or "thanks" won't count. Instead, aim for meaningful contributions that add value to the discussion.

## Modes of Learning & Teaching

The course will consist of several teaching methods:

1. Lectures
2. Programming Exercise (5 MPs)
3. Final Project and Presentation
4. Mid-term and Final Exam

## Lecture Notes

All lecture notes can be found on Canvas.

## Required Reading List

- Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein

We're looking forward to seeing you in class and can't wait to see what you will create!
